Created CRUD with Java Persistent API, project managed by Maven and data being inserted into H2 Database.

Project developed from two entities with many-to-many relationship, 
exception collection and handling and using Data Transfer Object (DTO) so that the service class does not have direct access to the entities. 

The project uses Postman for sending and receiving requests.
